"""Memory injection — assembles dynamic prompt additions from all memory layers.

This is the single point where memory becomes action: before each agent
call, we query examples, mistakes, and episodes to build a context block
that gets prepended to the user prompt.

Keeps it under ~500 tokens to avoid bloating context. Quality over quantity —
one good example beats ten mediocre ones.
